What I have so far:
- HTML is parsed
- word frequencies are calculated
- words are stemmed 
- tf-idf's calculated
- top n "important" words are found

Need to recalculate tf-idf's, because now I need to choose an approach:
- use original words to calculate tf-idf's, with words like "apartments", and "apartment" remaining (as-is)
- or, for use the stemmed words to calculate tf-idf's
- or, re-calculate tf-idf's for each stemmed word, where the tf-idf value is average of all of its original words
- or, for each original word, stem it, get it's other forms, get tf-idf values of those, and take average (good that it keeps the main original important word as the form to use)

Other things to consider:
- proper nouns consisting of several words, eg. "City Park Apartments" should stay together
