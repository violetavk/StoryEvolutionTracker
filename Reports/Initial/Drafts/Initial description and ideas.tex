\section{Project Description}
\paragraph{}
This project will involve news stories and how they change over time. A user will specify a link to a news story and the system will keep track of it. It will search for any developments in the topic from a set of pre-defined sources and notify the user about any new ones. A signature will be created for the news story to allow for identification, even if the headlines do not match the original ones. This will be implemented as an Android application.
\paragraph{}
There are many directions in which this project can go and many things to decide on, which makes it very interesting. I would need to consider many features like:
\begin{itemize}
\item How news stories will be tracked and monitored in terms of what processes would need to happen to get new developments to the user
\item If news stories would only be tracked from that point onwards or to also look back in time for relevant articles
\item News story suggestions based on either determining what the user likes (learning about the user) or asking them up-front about their interests, depending on what was in the news article
\item How much of the news story to send to the user, i.e. the whole story or snippets
\item How often to check the external news sources for new articles
\item Hardware-related things like power, data consumption, \ldots
\end{itemize}

\section{Topics to look into}
\begin{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Tasks to do}
